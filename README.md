# Objective :

The goal of this project is to analyze the onset of diabetes based on diagnostic measures.

# Dataset :

[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/blood-transfusion-dataset]

# About Data :

Blood Transfusion Service Center Data Set.

Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The "Blood Transfusion Service Center" is a classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.
R (Recency - months since last donation), F (Frequency - total number of donation), M (Monetary - total blood donated in c.c.), T (Time - months since first donation), and a binary variable representing whether he/she donated blood in March 2007 (1 stand for donating blood; 0 stands for not donating blood). 

# Implementation : 
Libraries: 
1. matplotlib 
2. pandas 
3. sklearn

# Classification Report:
The performance of the model is calculated using accuracy_score function.It computes the accuracy, either the fraction (default) or the count (normalize=False) of correct predictions.

I have got 73.68% accuracy which I think is pretty good ;)
